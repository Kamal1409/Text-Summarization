# Text-Summarization
Overview
Text Summarization is the process of automatically generating a condensed version of a given text while preserving the key information. This project aims to implement and evaluate various techniques for summarizing text, including extractive and abstractive approaches.

Features
Extractive Summarization: Selects important sentences from the original text to create a summary.
Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences to create a summary that might not contain the exact words from the original text.
Multiple Model Support: Integrates different machine learning and deep learning models for summarization.
Customizable: Allows users to adjust summarization parameters, including summary length, language, and more.
